## Color Pairing Rules

### Pairing Blue-Green with Citrus Orange

**Balancing Calm and Freshness**
Citrus Orange tones (Citrus Sunrise, Coral Reef, and Rustic Sunset) bring bold warmth and vibrancy.

To keep designs balanced, pair them with calming blue-green tones like Ocean Mist, Coastal Breeze, or Legacy Green.

**Critical Rules:**
- **Always separate Citrus Orange and blue-green hues with a neutral buffer** to avoid visual overload
- **Always use neutral colors** like Seashell Sand, Coconut Husk, or Woodland Oak to separate and soften combinations
- Follow tint guidelines to control intensity of neutrals
- Follow percentage guides for color hierarchy
- **Avoid placing Citrus Orange directly next to blue-green without separation**
- Use the color hierarchy guide to maintain a cohesive, harmonious design

### Citrus Orange Tone Pairings

**Balancing Warmth and Energy**
The Citrus Orange tones bring energy, warmth, and vibrancy to the brand.

To keep designs balanced, they should be paired thoughtfully with neutral tones like Seashell Sand, Coconut Husk, or Woodland Oak. This ensures the bold colors shine without overwhelming the design.

**How to Use:**
- Pair Citrus Sunrise with only one supporting Citrus Orange tone for balance
- Ground high-energy pairings with neutral tones to avoid visual overload
- Follow the color hierarchy guidelines for percentage usage
- Use supporting colors strategically to complement Citrus Sunrise without competing with it

**Example Pairings:**
1. Citrus Sunrise + Seashell Sand
2. Citrus Sunrise + Coral Reef + Coconut Husk (30% tint)
3. Citrus Sunrise + Rustic Sunset + Woodland Oak (10% tint)
4. Citrus Sunrise + Golden Sunset + Woodland Oak (20% tint)
